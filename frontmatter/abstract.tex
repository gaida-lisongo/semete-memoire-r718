This work presents the design, modeling, and simulation of an ejector refrigeration system operating with the natural refrigerant R718 (water).

The main objective is the inverse dimensioning of the system based on two input parameters: the evaporator cooling capacity and the evaporation temperature.
The developed model automatically computes thermodynamic states, mass flow rates, coefficient of performance (COP), and diagnostic indicators.

An advanced ejector model including supersonic compressible flow, normal shock detection, and suction regime analysis was implemented.

A graphical user interface enables dynamic visualization of system behavior and thermodynamic diagrams (P-h and T-s).

Results demonstrate thermodynamic consistency and successful convergence of the global system dimensioning.
